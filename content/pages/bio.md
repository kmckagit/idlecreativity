My name is Kristin Anderson.

I began working with fused glass several years ago as an outlet to my daily analytical work as an 
Engineering Director. And it was love at first sight as I let myself go with the moment to add color and 
design. I fell in love with the creativity it allows experimenting each day and challenging myself with 
new techniques, mediums and colors and often not knowing what to expect until I open the kiln at the end 
of its cycle. What fun!

I make all of my glass in my home studio with a goal of constantly exploring and learning new things 
hopefully resulting in a beautiful and functional piece.

My fused glass art led my involvement with the non-profit Florence Regional Arts Alliance where 
I can combine my love of working with people with my love of art.  FRAA gives me this synergy.

I am also a member of Backstreet Gallery which is a Co-op art gallery where I currently serve as 
Treasurer.
